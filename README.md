📧 Automated Email Notification System for S3 Uploads

A serverless event-driven pipeline using AWS S3, Lambda & SES

This project implements a real-world automated notification system that sends an email with the uploaded file attached every time a new asset is uploaded to an S3 bucket. It uses AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, and Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) and is fully infrastructure-as-code deployable using Terraform.

This is a great practice project for learning serverless architectures, event-driven pipelines, AWS IAM security, Terraform, and SES email delivery workflows.
